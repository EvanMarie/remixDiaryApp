It helps show how text will look once a piece of content is finished, during the planning phase.\n\nFiller text has been widely used for centuries, so most people are familiar with seeing Lorem Ipsum text on a mock design. This means, when a designer sends their template to a client, they won’t get distracted by the copy on-page.\n\nRead on to find out what Lorem Ipsum means, why we use it, and how to start creating Lorem Ipsum copy in your design.\n\n \n\nWhat is Lorem Ipsum?\nLorem Ipsum, sometimes referred to as ‘lipsum’, is the placeholder text used in design when creating content. It helps designers plan out where the content will sit, without needing to wait for the content to be written and approved.\n\nIt originally comes from a Latin text, but to today’s reader, it’s seen as gibberish. This is the clever bit, as it helps show what on-page text will look like – without distracting from the main focus, the overall design.\n\nWhere is Lorem Ipsum used?\nTraditionally, Lorem Ipsum text was used for specimen papers in the print industry. Then, as the industry developed, the text began to show up in transfer sheets and on word processors.\n\nToday, the text can be used for any copy, both print and digital. This could include:\n\nLetter headings\nProduct descriptions\nBrand bios\nContact details\nWeb pages\nCalls to action\n"}]}
